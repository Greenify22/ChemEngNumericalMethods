Numerical Methods 
Repository for MatLab code containing the solutions to some chemical engineering numerical methods. 

Problem 1:

The Van Der Waals equation of state relates Pressure (P), temperature (T) and molar volume (Vm) of a Nitrogen (P+0.141/Vm^2)(Vm-(3.913*10^-5))=RT

Where 
P = 810400Pa 
T = 570K
R = 8.314 Pamol

Write MatLab programs to solve the Van Der Waals Equation for the molar volume of gas using :

a)	The bisection method within the initial interval 0.001 <= Vm <= 0.1 (in m3)
b)	The simple iteration method starting from an initial guess of Vm = 0.1 m3
c)	The Newton-Raphson method starting from an initial guess of Vm = 0.1 m3
Using a tolerance of Ea = 10^-4, 10^-6 and 10^-8, with a maximum number of iterations of 100. 

Incooperate the final root estimate, the final error estimate and the number of iterations taken to find each root.
